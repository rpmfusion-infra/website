So, you've decided to become a contributor to RPM Fusion? This guide will lead you through your first package submission and teach you how to update your package(s) in the future.
Please also have a look on the [Fedora counterpart](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Join_the_package_collection_maintainers)

## Becoming a RPM Fusion contributor
Having packaging experience in Fedora is much preferred, but newcomers are welcome too.
However if you are a newcomer (as in you're not a Fedora sponsored packager) you must first get sponsored, which means find someone to guide you while you learn the process.

### Create a Bugzilla Account
In either scenario you should create your first RPM Fusion package and submit it for review as described below. The review process is handled through Bugzilla, as will be any bugs reported against your packages.

Make sure you have an account in Bugzilla.

The email address that you use for your Bugzilla account should be the same email address as you use for all other things related to RPM Fusion.


### Get an RPM Fusion Account

1. Create an account in the RPM Fusion [Account System]( https://admin.rpmfusion.org/accounts/)

    :::note
    **fas email** must be the same of bugzilla email (to allow be added as Point-of-contact).

    :::

1. Sign the CLA (if you click on the `My Account` link in the top right, you should see `CLA: CLA Done`).

1. Edit your account and upload your Public RSA SSH Key (see man ssh-keygen for more information) which is required for GIT authorization.

    :::info
    It might takes up to 24 hours before the new key is synced with the rest of the infrastructure.
    :::

1. Once you get email confirmation that your account has been created and you're a member of the cla_done group, return to edit your account:

1. Apply for the [packager group](https://admin.rpmfusion.org/accounts/group/view/packager).

    Once this is done, your account will show up as "pending" to all of the RPM Fusion sponsors (who will receive an email).
    When you are sponsored, you will be automatically added/approved to the rpmfusionbugs group as well. This will allow you to make changes to the state of bugs in Bugzilla, which is what you'll need to do to get them checked in. It will also allow you to do complete package reviews, including approving packages yourself!

### Join the Mailing List
Once this is done, join the Developers Mailing Lists and introduce yourself there. Include a link to the review request for your first package in your introduction, and if you're a newcomer also mention that you need someone to sponsor you.

If you have questions about the packaging process, this is the place to ask.

Also join the RPM Fusion GIT commits mailing list. The GIT commits mailing list is used for commit messages from the GIT repository. You should subscribe to this list to track the changes to all the packages.


### Install RPMFusion packager tools and set your environment
Before starting next steps (importing your package or request a build) install rpmfusion-packager and rfpkg

```shell
sudo dnf install rpmfusion-packager
```

This provides a set of utilities that helps a RPMFusion packager in setting up automatically their environment to access to the git-dist and build server. The package already includes installation of others useful packages like the rfpkg. And after, just run rpmfusion-packager-setup with no options as a non-root user.


rpmfusion-packager-setup
Next, set your environment :

Start ssh-agent to ensure that git uses your id_rsa key:


ssh-agent $SHELL
or

keychain -q ~/.ssh/id_rsa

### Import your package
Once the git module has been created, the package must be imported.
The only file that you have to import is the "src.rpm" file, no more and one at a time.

Then, checkout the common tool and import your SRPM as follow :
```shell
rfpkg clone <namespace>/<my_new_package>
cd <my_new_package>
rfpkg import ~/foo.src.rpm
rfpkg ci -c 
rfpkg new-sources my_packager-1.0.tar.gz
rfpkg commit
rfpkg push
```

During the GIT import procedure, your source files will be automatically tagged for the requested branch.

```shell
{i} <namespace> is the section where your git module should be imported/go (free or nonfree).
```

### Request a build
If you have already setup your environment (see two items ago), go on and request a build. Move to the directory where the source files are:

```shell
rfpkg clone free/my_package
cd my_package
vim my_package.spec
```

You may also request a scratch build to test build before do a git commit and push .

```shell
rfpkg --release f34 scratch-build --arches ppc64le --srpm
```

And finally upload source , commit changes and push it

```shell
rfpkg new-sources my_packager-1.0.tar.gz
rfpkg commit
rfpkg push
```

Then request a build to the koji server
```shell
rfpkg build
```

This will trigger a build request for the branch. Easy! You can check the status of the build process from the koji web interface.

Once the package built successfully, go back to your bug review and add a comment to the review to notify the import and build have been done correctly. Then close the bug as RESOLVED FIXED.

If there is a request for your package in the RPM Fusion Wishlist, please remove the related entry and commit the change in the wiki with a comment saying that the package is now in RPM Fusion.

### If SSL certificate expired
If during import you get the following error:

Could not execute import_srpm: (35, 'Peer reports failure of signature verification or key exchange.')
Since rpmfusion-packager-0.6.1 we got rpmfusion-cert
```shell
rpmfusion-cert -v for verify
rpmfusion-cert -n to create a new certificate
```

If ~/.rpmfusion-server-ca.cert or ~/.rpmfusion-upload-ca.cert were generated before Apr 24 2018 (due these certificates has expired), you need update them, first remove them with rm ~/.rpmfusion-upload-ca.cert and ~/.rpmfusion-server-ca.cert, next run fedora-package-setup and after renew your client cert with rpmfusion-cert -n

The old method which is download manually a client-side certificate from: https://admin.rpmfusion.org/accounts/user/gencert and save it as ~/.rpmfusion.cert still working, if you need it for some reason as alternative.

## Co-maintaining an existing package
You can offer to co-maintain a package in RPM Fusion. Please see Fedora's documentation on co-maintainership. To get commit privileges to an existing package, see "Package Change Requests for existing packages" in the CVS Requests documentation.

Even if you don't have an RPM Fusion account, it can be useful to anonymously checkout a package's GIT module for various reasons. In such case, you can use the following command :
```shell
rfpkg clone -a <namespace>/<module>
```

where `<namespace>` is either free or nonfree and `<module>` is the package's name.

## Updating an existing package
Make sure you have your environment set as in the Import your package subsection. You can then follow the Fedora Package Update HOWTO.

Example:
```shell
# Set the environment:
rfpkg clone <namespace>/<module>

# Download the new upstream source and save it to the branch directory you are updating (if applies):
cd module
wget -N http://dl.sf.net/foo/foo-0.0.2.tar.bz2

# Upload the tarball to an external lookaside cache (not yet working)
rfpkg new-sources "foo-0.0.2.tar.bz2"

# Small patches, initscripts or otherwise plain text files can be commited directly to GIT:
git add foo-fix-the-bar.patch

# Change the required things in the specfile:
emacs foo.spec

# Check that the changes you made are correct:
git diff 

# Create a changelog entry (clog) and commit the changes:
rfpkg ci -c

# check what you going to push 
git show

# Tag and request build (ex make tag build ) :
rfpkg push 

#we may also do: rfpkg tag (but not required)
rfpkg build

# Resubmit a failed build:
koji-rpmfusion resubmit <taskID>  (note is not the buildID) 

# or as alternative 
git checkout f24; rfpkg build; git checkout master
```

#"rfpkg build" is safe because check before if we already built it, if build is already
#done, reply something like: 
#Could not execute build: Package mpgtx-1.3.1-9.fc23 has already been
#built
#Note: You can skip this check with --skip-nvr-check. See help for more
#info.
A package built for devel (i.e. rawhide) will directly go to the "devel" repository.

A package built for a stable release (e.g. f24, f23) will go to the "updates-testing" repository. You'll have to wait a period ranging from 10 to 14 days for your package to be transferred to the "updates" repository. It's a manual action, somebody real actually does that, so don't panic.

You can also find packages which are built but not yet pushed here: http://koji.rpmfusion.org/mash/

## Requesting a new branch for a package
You can request new branches for a package at https://admin.rpmfusion.org/pkgdb

## Retiring a package
In order to retire a branch of a package, the maintainer needs to delete all but a dead.package file containing an explanation of why the package/branch has been retired.

A package cannot be retired in stable branches, only in master (rawhide) and branched (e.g. f31 until Fedora 31 is released). An EL branch can be retired at any time.

Once that's done, the maintainer must file a bugzilla ticket in the '''Infrastructure''' product and '''Repo''' component asking the package to be blocked in koji.

This can be done using the following command:

rfpkg retire
At this time, the command cannot retire the package in pkgdb. You need to orphan then retire it manually from the web interface on the related branches.

Then file a ticket for the package to be properly retired in koji.

## Orphaning a package
FIXME : Work out and describe the process to orphan a package.

## Requesting a buildroot override
You can use the following command to request a buildroot override :
```shell
koji-rpmfusion tag-build f2?-{,non}free-override your_rpmfusion_build_nvr
```

After wait for repo be ready:
```shell
koji-rpmfusion wait-repo f2?-{,non}free-build --build=your_rpmfusion_build_nvr
```

Exemplify
```shell
koji-rpmfusion tag-build f25-free-override VirtualBox-5.1.4-3.fc25
koji-rpmfusion wait-repo f25-free-build --build=VirtualBox-5.1.4-3.fc25
```

It's not possible to tag a fedora package, that's a manual task. In this case, please file a bug in product "Infrastructure" and component "Build System".

It is currently not possible to expire a buildroot override, but that is being worked on.

## Requesting a buildroot override but for one package from Fedora
As we do not build with updates-testing repos enabled, it's sometime needed for a package to be build and pushed in sync with others fedora packages.

Please submit a specific bug for the package you want to build and block this bug: https://bugzilla.rpmfusion.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4501

## Making the build available in the repository
RPM Fusion doesn't use Bodhi like Fedora to request moving package to testing repository then stable repository.
Packages are pushed manually by the admins from time to time.

## Manually moving a package from testing repository to updates repository
In some rare cases, packages needs to be moved in sync with packages in Fedora. For example, chromium, qt-webengine, etc.... For such cases, and only such cases, one can move a package using koji-rpmfusion move-build command.

Here is an example :

```shell
koji-rpmfusion move-build f29-free-updates-testing f29-free-updates package-version-release
````

:::warning
WARNING: Never move a package from candidate to testing, or from updates to stable. Only testing to stable is safe, because packages in candidate have not been signed yet.
