1. [Set up your environment](/docs/contribute/new-pkg-submit#import-your-package)

1. Retrieve the package configuration (if not done already)
    ```shell
    rfpkg clone free/my_package
    cd my_package
    ```

    :::tip
    You may also request a scratch build to test build before do a git commit and push .

    ```shell
    rfpkg --release f34 scratch-build --arches ppc64le --srpm
    ```
    :::

1. Upload source, commit changes and push them
    ```shell
    rfpkg new-sources my_packager-1.0.tar.gz
    rfpkg commit
    rfpkg push
    ```

1. Request a build to the koji server
    ```shell
    rfpkg build
    ```

    This will trigger a build request for the branch. Easy!
    You can check the status of the build process from the [koji web interface](http://koji.rpmfusion.org/koji/tasks).


:::tip If SSL certificate has expired
If during import you get the following error:

> Could not execute import_srpm: (35, 'Peer reports failure of signature verification or key exchange.')

1. Check your certificate validity
    ```shell
    rpmfusion-cert -v for verify
    ```
1. Renew your certificates
    ```shell
    rpmfusion-cert -n
    ```

* Update your certificate the old-school way:
    ```shell
    wget https://admin.rpmfusion.org/accounts/user/gencert -O ~/.rpmfusion.cert
    ```
