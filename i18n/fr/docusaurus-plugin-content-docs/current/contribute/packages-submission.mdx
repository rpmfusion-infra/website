RPM Fusion follows the [Fedora packaging guidelines](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/), so make sure you've read and understood them.
Also, please read our [Kmod standard guidelines](/docs/contribute/pkg-kmod) if you will be packaging external kernel modules.


## Create a package review request

1. Upload your SRPM and SPEC files to any accessible location on the internet.

1. Create a [new bug report](https://bugzilla.rpmfusion.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Package%20Reviews).
1. Set Summary to: `Review request: <package_name> - <package_summary>`.
1. Put the following in the Description field:

    * The Full public URLs to the spec file and source rpm of the package.
    * A short description for the package (usually, the `%description` content from the spec file).
    * A description of why this package is not eligible to be included in Fedora.
    * The output that rpmlint gives on both the source (SRPM) and built binary packages.
    :::note
    Explain for each message why you've chosen to ignore errors/warning msgs from rpmlint.
    :::
    * Mention if this is your first RPM Fusion package.
    * Mention that you are seeking for a sponsor if you are not a Fedora sponsored packager or an RPM Fusion sponsored packager.

1. Add to the field **blocks** the tracker bug: `RF_NEW` ([bug #2](https://bugzilla.rpmfusion.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2)).

    This way, other contributors can easily check for packages that need reviewing.

1. Add to the field **blocks** the tracker bug `NEEDSPONSORS` ([bug #30](https://bugzilla.rpmfusion.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30)), if you are seeking a sponsor.

    Thus, some potential sponsors will look at the NEEDSPONSORS bug to find packages to review. The only allowed sponsors in RPM Fusion are Fedora sponsors.

:::important
Please do not submit more than one package per Bugzilla entry, it would be very difficult to follow the review otherwise.
If you have related packages, it can be handy to trace all the dependencies using the "Depends On" or "Block" Bugzilla features.
:::

## Wait for your package to be reviewed

As time permits, a reviewer will review your package. A reviewer is either a Fedora sponsored packager or an RPM Fusion only sponsored packager.
Sometimes other people add a few comments, this does not constitute a valid review.

When a valid review starts, the reviewer assigns the bug to him/her, removes the blocker on `RF_NEW` and set it to block the tracker bug `RF_REVIEW` ([bug #3](https://bugzilla.rpmfusion.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2)).
This indicates that a review is in progress.

The reviewer should follow the [Fedora Review Guidelines](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/) as closed as possible, obviously taking into account any differences between Fedora and RPM Fusion.

As RPM Fusion is more permissive with the content it allows, exceptions to these guidelines are allowed in some circumstances but care and common sense should prevail.

The reviewer should ensure that any deviations from the Fedora Packaging Guidelines are sane and justified in the package they are reviewing.
If you have any doubts, please ask on the RPM Fusion mailing list.

The reviewer should inform the contributor of any changes that need to be made to their package, if any.
The contributor should update their package as necessary, including bumping the release version number, and submit the new SPEC file and source rpm URL.

The reviewer should verify the changes, this is a repeated process as many times as necessary until the contributor and reviewer are happy with the final package.


## Your package gets approved

When the reviewer approves the package, the reviewer adds a comment saying that the package has been approved,
the reviewer removes the blocker RF_REVIEW bug and sets fedora-review flag to "+". (only RPM Fusion packagers can do this).

Then you can submit a package admin request in [RPM Fusion pkgdb](https://admin.rpmfusion.org/pkgdb/).

:::note
As a reminder, the namespace tag specifies the repository in which you want to import your package: [Free](docs/get-started/intro) or [Nonfree](docs/get-started/intro)
:::

### Import your package

Once the git module has been created, the package must be imported.
The only file that you have to import is the "src.rpm" file, no more and one at a time.

Then, checkout the common tool and import your SRPM as follow :
```shell
rfpkg clone <namespace>/<package-name>
cd <package-name>
rfpkg import ~/<package-name>.src.rpm
rfpkg ci -c
rfpkg new-sources <package-name>-<version-number>.tar.gz
rfpkg commit
rfpkg push
```

During the GIT import procedure, your source files will be automatically tagged for the requested branch.

:::info
`namespace` is the section where your git module should be imported/go (free or nonfree).
:::

### Request a build

Go to [Build a package](/docs/contribute/build-pkg) section.

Once the package built successfully, go back to your bug review and add a comment to the review to notify that the import and build have been done correctly.
Then close the bug as `RESOLVED FIXED`.
